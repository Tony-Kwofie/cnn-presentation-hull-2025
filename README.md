## 🧩 Overview

### 🧠 What is a CNN?
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a deep learning model designed to process visual data such as images.  
It uses convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification.

## 🧪 Case Study: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (He et al., 2015)

- **Goal:** Simplify training of very deep neural networks.  
- **Dataset:** ImageNet (over 1 million images).  
- **Model:** ResNet (Residual Network) architecture.  
- **Result:** Achieved **96% top-5 accuracy**, setting a new standard for image recognition performance.  

🧩 **Key Innovation:** Residual connections that allow deeper networks to learn effectively by avoiding vanishing gradients.

## ⚖️ Ethical Issue: Bias in CNNs

**Topic:** Bias in facial recognition  
- CNNs may underperform on underrepresented demographic groups.  
- Ethical AI requires **balanced datasets**, **fairness testing**, and **continuous monitoring**.  
- Promotes responsible development and deployment of deep learning systems.

## 💬 Reflection

- Built and trained a CNN model on the **MNIST dataset** to classify handwritten digits.  
- Experimented with **Keras layers**, **dropout**, and **activation functions**.  
- Improved accuracy through **hyperparameter tuning** and **early stopping**.  
- Plan to extend to more complex datasets and integrate **explainable AI (XAI)** methods in future work.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Visualization:** CNN architecture diagrams, ResNet block illustration
